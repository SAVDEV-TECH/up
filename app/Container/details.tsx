        <p className='line-'>I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development, creating experiences that not only
             look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability.
             </p>
